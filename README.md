# Chaos-Mod
A mod to take any mutation in BN, even conflicting ones.

I regex'd out all "becomes" "cancels" and "thresreq" fields. Be who you wanna be.

Should the overwrite not work properly via outright removing those fields, you can replace the vanilla mutations.json at
data\json\mutations

License: The same as regular Bright Nights. I may support this but who knows.
